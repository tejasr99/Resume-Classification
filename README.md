# Resume-Classification

## As an Intern, I helped automate manual data extraction process by doing auto classification of resumes (which we in different formats such as docx, doc, pdf) using python aspose and nltk. This work should significantly reduce the manual human effort. It should achieve a higher level of accuracy and automation with minimal human intervention for the company.
